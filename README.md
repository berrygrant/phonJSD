# phonJSD

**phonJSD** is an R package for measuring phonological category separation using **Jensen–Shannon Divergence (JSD)**.  
It is designed for researchers working in sociophonetics, laboratory phonology, bilingualism, and speech perception who need a principled, distributional metric of category overlap in acoustic space.

Version **0.0.1** is an early research release focused on core functionality, transparency, and reproducibility.

## Motivation

Traditional measures of phonological contrast (e.g., Euclidean distance between means, Pillai scores) capture only limited aspects of category structure.  
**phonJSD** treats phonological categories as **probability distributions** in acoustic space and quantifies their separation using Jensen–Shannon Divergence—a symmetric, bounded, and interpretable information-theoretic metric.

This approach is especially useful when:
- Categories differ in **shape, variance, or multimodality**
- Token counts are unbalanced
- Category overlap is gradient rather than categorical
- You want a measure that generalizes naturally to **multidimensional features** (e.g., MFCCs)

## Core Features (v0.0.1)

- Jensen–Shannon Divergence for phonological category comparison  
- Kernel density–based estimation of acoustic distributions  
- Support for **1D and n-dimensional acoustic features**
- Reproducible pipelines compatible with tidyverse workflows
- Designed for integration with forced alignment and acoustic extraction tools

## Conceptual Overview

Given two phonological categories (e.g., vowels /ɪ/ and /ɛ/), phonJSD:

1. Represents each category as a probability distribution over acoustic space  
2. Estimates densities using kernel density estimation (KDE)  
3. Computes Jensen–Shannon Divergence between the distributions  

JSD values:
- **0** → complete overlap (no separation)
- **Higher values** → greater distributional separation  
- **Bounded and symmetric**, making cross-study comparisons more interpretable
