#' phonJSD: Information-Theoretic Measures of Phonological Category Separation
#'
#' Tools for quantifying separation between phonological categories
#' (e.g., vowels, consonants) using Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) in
#' arbitrary n-dimensional acoustic spaces such as formants, MFCCs,
#' spectral features, or learned embeddings. The package provides unified 
#' functions to estimate global and group-level JSD (with optional bootstrap),
#' and comparison metrics such as the Pillai–Bartlett trace and 
#' Bhattacharyya distance.
