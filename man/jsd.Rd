\title{Jensen–Shannon divergence for discrete distributions}
\usage{
jsd(p, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{p, q}{Numeric probability vectors of the same length.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value: the Jensen–Shannon divergence in bits.
}
\description{
Computes JSD(p, q) in bits for discrete probability vectors.
The value is bounded in \code{[0, 1]} for equally weighted mixtures.
