\title{phonJSD: Information-Theoretic Measures of Phonological Category Separation}
\description{
Tools for quantifying separation between phonological categories
(e.g., vowels, consonants) using Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) in
arbitrary n-dimensional acoustic spaces such as formants, MFCCs,
spectral features, or learned embeddings. The package provides unified
functions to estimate global and group-level JSD (with optional bootstrap),
and comparison metrics such as the Pillai–Bartlett trace and
Bhattacharyya distance.
