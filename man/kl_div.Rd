\title{Kullback–Leibler divergence for discrete distributions}
\usage{
kl_div(p, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{p, q}{Numeric probability vectors of the same length.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value: the KL divergence in bits.
}
\description{
Computes KL(p || q) in bits for discrete probability vectors.
Zeros are handled by replacing them with a small epsilon.
