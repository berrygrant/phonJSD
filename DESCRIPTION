Description: Tools for quantifying separation between phonological categories 
    (e.g., vowels, consonants) using information-theoretic measures such as 
    Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) in arbitrary n-dimensional acoustic spaces 
    (e.g., MFCCs, formants, duration). Includes utilities for computing 
    group-level JSD (e.g., per speaker), bootstrap confidence intervals, 
    and preparing JSD estimates for downstream modelling (GAMs, mixed-effects 
    models). Also provides comparison metrics including the Pillai-Bartlett 
    trace and Bhattacharyya distance under multivariate normality assumptions.
